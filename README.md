# Cryptocurrency Cluster Analysis Using K-Means and PCA

## Introduction
In the evolving world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the underlying patterns is crucial.
This project provides a deep dive into the realm of cryptocurrencies using advanced clustering techniques.
By leveraging the K-Means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
we aim to uncover hidden patterns and relationships among various coins.

## Data Preparation

- Data preprocessing is an essential step in any machine learning or data analysis task.
- We began by sourcing our cryptocurrency data, ensuring its reliability.
- Handling missing data was our next priority. Only active cryptocurrencies were considered for analysis.
- To ensure that our clustering algorithm works optimally, feature scaling was performed.
  This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

## Cluster Analysis Without PCA

- Our initial analysis started without the implementation of PCA.
- We wanted to use this as a benchmark, understanding how K-Means interprets the raw, unscaled data.
- This would provide insights into how the algorithm behaves with a full set of features.

## Cluster Analysis With PCA

- Post our initial analysis, we implemented PCA to optimize our data.
- Dimensionality reduction, like PCA, reduces the feature set but still captures maximum data variance.
- With a reduced set of principal components, K-Means clustering was reapplied.
- The goal was to understand the differences, if any, between the clusters formed with and without PCA.

## Results and Insights

- Visualization tools provided a clear representation of our clusters.
- It was evident that PCA offered more distinct cluster formations.
- This suggests that the original dataset, while comprehensive, contained redundant or less informative features.
- By using PCA, we emphasized on the most crucial data aspects, leading to more informed clusters.

## Conclusion

- Data clustering, especially with numerous features, can be challenging.
- Our project showcased the potential benefits of using PCA alongside K-Means clustering.
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction stand out as key steps in enhancing machine learning outcomes.
- In the context of cryptocurrencies, this methodology can provide invaluable insights for investors, analysts, and enthusiasts.
